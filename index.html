            <h2> Famous San Diego Landmarks</h2>
            <p><strong> The San Diego Zoo </strong> is one of the top zoos in the world. From monkeys swinging from branch to branch, 
                to towering giraffes and trumpeting elephants, the San Diego Zoo is home to more than 3,700 rare and endangered 
                animals and counting. Plus, did you know the zoo is also a botanical garden with over 700,000 types of plants? If this is 
                your first time at the zoo, it is highly recommended you take a bus tour, included with your pass, to get to see the many amazing 
                animals that live there. A second zoo, <strong>The San Diego Zoo Safari Park</strong>is another treasure you don’t want to miss. 
                The 1,800-acre park allows visitors to go on a safari adventure unlike any other. Between the behind-the-scenes
                experiences and seeing animals in their natural habitats, you’re sure to have a wild time at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Cabrillo National Monument</strong> is a historic monument that commemorates the story of Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo, who
                arrived at San Diego Bay in Spetember 1542. Upon discovery, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo actually called the area, “San Miguel”.
                It wasn’t until 60 years later that the area was named “San Diego” by explorer Sebastian Vizcaino. While at the monument, 
                you can explore the statue of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, learn about his voyage, and gaze out into the ocean from the Old Point Loma lighthouse.
            </p>
            <p><strong> The USS Midway Museum </strong> is an authentic U.S. Navy aircraft carrier with over 60 exhibites, self-guided tours,
                29 restored aircrafts and outstanding ocean views from the flight deck. Visitors will hear stories from Desert Storm pilots and experience
                life aboard the famous vessel. Daredevils can hop into a flight simulator and "jet off" into the sky. 
            </p>
            <p><strong> Balboa Park </strong> is known as one of the best parks in the world. The park houses 15 museums, performing arts venues, 
                botanical gardens, cultural and recreational attractions, and the San Diego Zoo. </p>
            <p><strong>Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve</strong> is one of 16 parks with reserve status. This means that everything in the reserve
            is exactly as it was before the entire city of San Diego was built. From the calming trails to the incredinle beaches, this natural reserve
            is one of San Diego's true treasures.</p>
            <p><strong>Old Town San Diego</strong> is known as the birthplace of California. Here you can learn about San Diego's past, visit local
                shops or attend a festival. With so much history and fun packed into one neighborhood, it's no wonder why it made the list of top San Diego landmarks.
