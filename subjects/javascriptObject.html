                <p>Jimmy grew up in a small town Central Pennsylvania. After graduating high school,
                    he did a year of school at Brigham Young University - Idaho. After his first year
                    he served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Riverside, California.
                    When he completed his mission, he moved to Salt Lake Utah where he attended and graduated from the
                    University
                    of Utah with a Bachelors in Finance. He fell in love with California during his church mission
                    and moved to San Diego, California shortly after graduation.
                </p>
                <p>Shelby grew up just outside of Salt Lake City in Sandy, Utah. When she completed high school
                    she attended Utah State University and was pursuing a degree in special education. While she was
                    attending school, an opportunity came for her to move to San Diego, California for a year to be a
                    nanny for a family friend. She had a strong impression that this is where she needed to go
                    so she continued her schooling online at Salt Lake Community College while she lived in San Diego.
                    Shortly after moving to San Diego, she met Jimmy. They dated for a year and half before getting married
                    in the San Diego Temple. Shelby continued to nanny while she continued with her education at Brigham
                    Young
                    University-Idaho in Web Design.
                </p>
                <p>James just turned two years old. He is a very busy, active boy. He loves the moveies Cars, Toy Story and
                    really enjoys watching episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. His favorite activity is swimming and he is
                    starting
                    to swim unassisted. He loves to sit on the edge of the pool and jump in. He is excited about being
                    promoted to big
                    brother in the next year.
